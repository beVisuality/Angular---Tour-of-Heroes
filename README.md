# AngularTourOfHeroes

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.3.4. for learn basic Angular skills.

Master branch contains my final version of Angular - Tour of Heroes Tutorial.
To learn and practice git I made a dev branch too.

## My cheet sheet to git

#### When you begin a new project:
git init

#### Create necessary branches:
git branch [branch-name]

#### To add a new remote:
git remote add [remote-name] [remote-url | https://github.com/user/repo.git]

#### When you finish a section:
git add .
git commit -m "Short description about the section"

#### When you want to add your work to another branch:
Select target branch:
git checkout [target-branch-name]
Add your work:
git merge [branch-name-you-worked-in]

#### When you want to upload your current work:
git push [remote-name] [branch-name]

#### When you want to upload all branch:
git push [remote-name] -all


#### Angular short Docs.
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.
Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).
